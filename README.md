# PaS

A clean and fast implement of Pruning-as-Search: Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Channel Pruning and Structural Reparameterization. To be appear in IJCAI 2022

## 1. Requirements:
This repo works with:

* Python >= 3.6

* CUDA >= 10.0 

* Nvidia/apex

* PyTorch >= 1.6.0 

* torchvision

## 2. dataset 
```
$ ln -s /where/is/imagenet/train/ train
$ ln -s /where/is/imagenet/val/ val
```

## 3. train

For now we released the searched models here. 

We are cleaning the search and training code. Please stay tuned.
